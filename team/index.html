         <h2>Mahdi Azarmi</h2>
         <h3>UTEA Undergraduate Researcher</h3>
            <p>
                Mahdi is a fourth-year HBSc student specializing in Biotechnology at the University of Toronto whose current research in the lab focuses on how oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) respond to senescence during neuroinflammation - in other words, why certain brain cells seem to retire early when things get stressful.
                He has a strong interest in the molecular mechanism of disease, particularly in how various pathways and proteins interact.
                Outside the lab, Mahdi can often be found going on walks or enjoying a warm tea while binging a favorite show.</p>

         <h3>ROP Student</h3>
            <p>Mary is an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto Mississauga, completing her HBSc with a major in Biology for Health Sciences and minors in Chemistry and Biomedical Communication.
            She is interested in neurobiology and exploring the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive human diseases.
            Currently in the Ghorbani Lab, Mary is investigating the senescence profile of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in EAE mice and human MS lesions using single-cell RNA sequencing datasets.
            Outside of the lab, Mary enjoys drawing, painting, reading Webtoons, traveling, spending time at the library with a cup of matcha or coffee, and staying active through boxing and biking.</p>
